# REP_MouldRisk_Data_Analysis
Project Overview
This repository contains research and modeling resources for a project supervised by Prof. Hong Yang from the University of Reading, focusing on climate change-induced flood risks and subsequent mould growth in South England. It employs the UKCP18 data for climate assessment and the VTT+Kmeans model for predicting mould growth, with additional analysis using an Airthings Air Quality Monitor.

Repository Structure
HAM: Scripts related to Heat, Air, and Moisture model simulations.
Mould Prediction Source Code: Main source code for mould risk prediction.
Test_Temp_Ann: Annotations and test scripts for temperature data.
VTT Model Demo: Demonstrative scripts showcasing the VTT model application.
