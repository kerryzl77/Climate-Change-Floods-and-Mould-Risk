# REP_MouldRisk_Data_Analysis
Project Overview
This repository contains research and modeling resources for a project supervised by Prof. Hong Yang from the University of Reading, focusing on climate change-induced flood risks and subsequent mould growth in South England. It employs the UKCP18 model for flood risk assessment and the HAM model for predicting mould growth, with additional analysis using an Airthings Air Quality Monitor.
