## Data Acquisition
We began with the acquisition of time series data for the month of July 2022, collected at 5-minute intervals. This data primarily contained temperature (denoted as `Td`) and relative humidity (denoted as `RH`) readings.

## Data Cleaning
The initial data had some formatting issues, which included an additional header row. These were addressed by:
1. Removing the extraneous header.
2. Converting the `TimeStamp` column into a datetime format for easier manipulation.
3. Ensuring that the columns 'Td' and 'RH' were recognized as numeric data types.

## Modeling RHcrit
A critical relative humidity (RHcrit) model was constructed based on the given temperature. The model is defined as:
